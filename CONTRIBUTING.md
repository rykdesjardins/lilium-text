# Sharing is caring
Interested in lending a hand? 

## Codebase 
Let's [open an issue](https://github.com/rykdesjardins/lilium-text/issues) first and discuss what needs to be changed / added. 
You'll then be able to fork the repo, have fun with it, then [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/rykdesjardins/lilium-text/pulls). 
It will be easier afterwards to manage the repo if all merged pull requests are also closing one or multiple issues. 

Also... more green squares for you :)

## Ideas
If you would rather propose a solution to a problem, or suggest a feature without actually writing the code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rykdesjardins/lilium-text/issues).
Once the issue is discussed and accepted, it will have a `feature-request` label. Rejected ideas will be marked as `wont-fix`.

## Accessibility & browser support
I am currently working with [Narcity Media](https://github.com/narcitymedia) which will be using this editor in their publishing pipeline. 
That means we can ask the employees to use a recent browser. If this project is to grow, it will need backward compat.  


If you would like to help this project to become more accessible with plugins like "Speach-to-text", older browser support, etc. again, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rykdesjardins/lilium-text/issues) detailing the idea.
